<p>I am Dhara Mungra currently work as a Data Scientist at Bombora to develop the Identity Graph, which maps the business behavior of companies across the web. This graph helps identify companies that are researching specific topics or exhibiting buying signals online, which helps businesses target their marketing and sales efforts more effectively by identifying potential customers who are actively researching relevant topics. I graduated with an MS in Data Science from New York University in 2019.</p>

<p>I am also a member of <a href = "https://simppl.org/">SimPPL</a>, a student-run research collective advancing trust on the social internet by building and deploying open-access responsible AI tools. SimPPL serves dual purposes: mentoring aspiring research students and developing essential tools for non-profits and communities in the global south. In the past two years, I've led a group of students from India and Bangladesh in building real-world trust and safety tools in collaboration with newsrooms, civil society organizations, and nonprofits, guiding them in academic writing and connecting them with influential academics and professionals for career advancement. Additionally, our efforts have been financially sustainable, as we've successfully secured grants (a total of 120k USD) from organizations like Wikimedia, Google Cloud, Sunday Times, Anti Defamation League, and Tech Global Institute, allowing us to provide financial support to every participating student.</p>

<p>I am passionate about building responsible AI tools that allow people to access information safely and freely across the world irrespective of socioeconomic status, or language barriers.</p>
